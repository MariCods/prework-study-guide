# Prework-Study Guide Webpage


## Description

A repo for all the information learned in the pre-work study modules. Created with the motivation to have a easy, pretty way to access and study key topics about HTML, CSS, GitHub/Git Bash, and Javascript. I built this project in the hopes that I could help myself as well as others with studying these basic coding rules. This webpage functions as a easy fast way to be reminded or teach basic coding language and rules. I learned how to code basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As well as how to code in Git Bash and use Github as a repo.

Each section of this webpage contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. As well as a section about git; mostly Git Bash commands. If we open the DevTools console, we will see the JavaScript running under the console section. There it will list topics we learned from prework and it will choose one topic for us to study first.
