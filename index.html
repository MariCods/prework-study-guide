       <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>All visible elements on a webpage are postioned between two brackets. A opening and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>Tags are used to orgainze and structure content on a webpage using only html. Tags include header, body,and footer repectivly.</li>
          <li>For example a header tag or h# is used to orgainze the amount of headers and their postion on the page. Going from 1-6.</li>
          <li>p tags: represent a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>li tag: is another form of orgainzation. The list tag varies with Ol or Ordered lists and Ul or Unordered lists. Basically the difference between a bulleted or numbered list. </li>
          <li>img tags: are a bit different. Begining and ending with 1 open bracket. The most important quality about this element is the src which gives the location of the image</li>
          <li>The struture for the img tag, the br tag, and the link tag are all the same in that the visble code is between two open brackets. </li>
        </ul>

         <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three types of commonly used css coding practices. Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS. The later being the most common as it allows designers to keep code seperate, making the process easier.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is placed in the head section of HTML. It only applies to a page and only applies to single HTML tags mostly formated in a single line of code.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS applys only to specific HTML ids and classes on a single given page.</li>
          <li>link rel="stylesheet" href="./file name": is a piece of code placed in the header that connects the HTML page and the external CSS page.</li>
          <li>In the CSS Box Model the content is surronded by padding, which is surrounded by a border. This border is surrounded by a margin.</li>
          <li>When coding colors for selectors you can type a basic color or use hexadecimal code.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>cd: locates files in your computer directory.</li>
          <li>touch: creates a file in a chosen directory.</li>
          <li>A PR or pull request: is used to merge the comparison branch or in this case feature branch into the main branch for a project.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: makes sure the files are in sync between the local computer and the git repo.</li>
          <li>git push origin "file name": Is pushing the local file changes to the remote git repo.</li>
          <li>mkdir: creates a new directory.</li>
          <Li>cd ..: command is how you can go a step back when in a directory.</Li>
          <li>git checkout main: allows for a coder to get back to the main branch of a repo.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>console.log: is used when sending a message to the computer consol by adding a argument.</li>
          <li>.log() is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
          <li>script src="./assets/script.js": is the code you add to link your js file to your HTML. It is placed in the footer.</li>
          <li>Control+Shift+I can open the console panel.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. </li>
          <li>(If) statements: are ran by the computer till statement is proved truthy. If a statement is proved false the computer will ignore the code. </li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
          <li>In JS we can have more then one condition with the statement (else if).</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a store of a group of related data.</li>
          <li>The first item in the index of an array starts with 0 not 1.</li>
          <li>In arrays strings have quotations around them, but arrays can have more then strings in them, like booleans for example.</li>
          <li>console.log(shapes[0]);: is code telling the conputer to display one item in an array.</li>
          <li>Arrays still require the coder to type out a long list of code, to shorten it coders use loops.</li>
          <li>A loop in this case a for loop allows for a single code block to excuted over and over again.</li>
          <li>for(var x = 0; x greater then sign shapes.length; x++){
            console.log(shapes[x]);
           }: is a if code loop that allows the computer to excute the variables for the value of x from begining to end.</li>
