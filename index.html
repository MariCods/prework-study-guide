          <li>There are three types of commonly used css coding practices. Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS. The later being the most common as it allows designers to keep code seperate, making the process easier.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is placed in the head section of HTML. It only applies to a page and only applies to single HTML tags mostly formated in a single line of code.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS applys only to specific HTML ids and classes on a single given page.</li>
          <li>link rel="stylesheet" href="./file name": is a piece of code placed in the header that connects the HTML page and the external CSS page.</li>
          <li>In the CSS Box Model the content is surronded by padding, which is surrounded by a border. This border is surrounded by a margin.</li>
          <li>When coding colors for selectors you can type a basic color or use hexadecimal code.</li>
